# Rex Controller Java
Java implementation of [Griaule REX Controller](http://www.griaulebiometrics.com/pt-br/rex).

This code was written through reverse engineering, and _might_ be incomplete or wrong.

## Getting started

Use [veridis.embedded.rex.server.RexServer](src/veridis/embedded/rex/server/RexServer.java) as a template to write your code.

The code isn't polished or documented, but shouldn't be hard to use.
